// In this Kata you are expected to find the coefficients of quadratic equation of the given two roots (x1 and x2).

// Equation will be the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0

// Return type is a Vector (tuple in Rust, Array in Ruby) containing coefficients of the equations in the order (a, b, c).

// Since there are infinitely many solutions to this problem, we fix a = 1.

// Remember, the roots can be written like (x-x1) * (x-x2) = 0
